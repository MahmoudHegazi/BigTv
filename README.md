## I Added AJAX_FLASK_Jquery search funtion to my app at 127.0.0.1/mform

#### Rest Full API it has json end point, and it use Jquery and ajax with flask, it has relational database, I use SQLalchemy and CRUD
#### try /JSON extension to see JSON end points

You Don't have to reload the page to get your search result + you can search for new value and get new result
that's why they call the AJAX the Developer's Dream!

AJAX Search Function (with jquery):

If some one think there is a reapted code in search function so you don't understand the tags 
+ this search function faster than google search :D + it can search for multibplay results on
a diffrent tables not realted and with fast preformerance and with ajax this Search function Really Important
