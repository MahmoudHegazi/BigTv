You Don't have to reload the page to get your search result + you can search for new value and get new result
that's why they call the AJAX the Developer's Dream!

AJAX Search Function (with jquery):

If some one think there is a reapted code in search function so you don't understand the tags 
+ this search function faster than google search :D + it can search for multibplay results on
a diffrent tables not realted and with fast preformerance and with ajax this Search function Really Important
